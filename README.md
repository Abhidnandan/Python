A sommelier is a trained professional who spends his or her day tasting different wines, and 
identifying similarities (or sometimes dissimilarities) between these. Given this is clearly an exhausting
task, you have been hired to develop a software capable of grouping similar wines together. Your 
software will load a data set containing information about each wine (Alcohol content, alkalinity of ash, 
Proanthocyanins, colour intensity, etc) and identify which wines are similar.
